## Database layout
This repo now supports a clearer database flow:
- `database/schema.sql` — main schema source of truth for fresh installs
- `database/install_fresh_latest.sql` — convenience copy of the latest fresh-install schema
- `database/install_with_demo_seed.sql` — fresh install plus optional demo seed
- `database/update_latest_bundle.sql` — one consolidated update bundle for older installs
- `database/migrations/` — versioned upgrade files kept for patch history
- `database/archive/` — older archived SQL files kept only for historical reference

## Setup
### Fresh install
1. Copy `config.example.php` to `config.php`
2. Set your database credentials and secrets in `config.php`
3. Import `database/install_fresh_latest.sql`
4. Ensure these folders are writable:
   - `uploads/attachments`
   - `uploads/signatures`
   - `storage/logs`
5. Open `public/`


## Abuse protection
- Forgot-password requests now use lightweight email/IP throttling.
- Login now includes an additional per-IP network throttle on top of failed-login checks.
- Offline report sync batches are rate-limited and capped per request.


## Recent UX Polish
- Report workspace now includes stronger empty states, local autosave controls, clearer review guidance, and a more polished draft/review experience.

## Protected setup and developer utilities
- `public/setup.php` now requires an explicit setup key, environment-safe exposure, and POST confirmation before applying `database/schema.sql`.
- `public/tools/diagnose.php` requires a manager session, a configured dev-tool key, and environment-safe exposure. Diagnostic output defaults to a summary view and masks user emails.
- `public/tools/reset_password.php` remains deprecated and returns HTTP 410.


## Repo health and API contract
- API endpoints under `public/api/` use `api_json_success()` and `api_json_error()` wrappers for a consistent JSON contract.
- CI checks validate helper bootstrap references, include targets, and API contract usage.


## Route smoke checks
- CI now checks for brittle legacy route references so nested pages keep using `url()` and `api_url()` helpers after the folder restructure.
