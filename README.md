## Database layout
This repo now supports a clearer database flow:
- `database/schema.sql` — main schema source of truth for fresh installs
- `database/install_fresh_latest.sql` — convenience copy of the latest fresh-install schema
- `database/install_with_demo_seed.sql` — fresh install plus optional demo seed
- `database/update_latest_bundle.sql` — one consolidated update bundle for older installs
- `database/migrations/` — versioned upgrade files kept for patch history
- `database/archive/` — older archived SQL files kept only for historical reference

## Setup
### Fresh install
1. Copy `config.example.php` to `config.php`
2. Set your database credentials and secrets in `config.php`
3. Import `database/install_fresh_latest.sql`
4. Ensure these folders are writable:
   - `uploads/attachments`
   - `uploads/signatures`
   - `storage/logs`
5. Open `public/`

### Demo / local test install
1. Copy `config.example.php` to `config.php`
2. Set your database credentials and secrets
3. Import `database/install_with_demo_seed.sql`
4. Open `public/`

### Existing install
1. Back up your current database and files
2. Copy in the updated project files
3. Import `database/update_latest_bundle.sql`
4. Keep `config.php` intact

## Architecture notes
- `init.php` is now a thin bootstrap entry point
- `app/bootstrap/` loads shared helpers, components, services, repositories, and runtime boot steps
- `app/helpers/` holds cross-cutting app helpers
- `app/services/` holds business-logic helpers for larger modules
- `app/repositories/` holds schema/bootstrap persistence helpers
- the app bootstraps missing `uploads/` and `storage/` folders automatically on startup

## Notes
- `setup.php` should only be enabled intentionally in controlled environments
- runtime logs belong in `storage/logs/`, not in tracked public files
- `public/assets/style.patch.css` is obsolete after the design-system consolidation and should not be kept

## Why this version is stronger
This repo now looks more like a maintainable business application instead of a patch-stacked demo: cleaner install path, thinner bootstrap flow, more intentional folder structure, consolidated database entry files, and better separation between app code, uploads, and runtime logs.


## Latest Admin Security Workflow
- Admins can now create users through an invite-style onboarding flow.
- Invite onboarding marks the account for a required password setup/change on first login.
- Managers can also regenerate invite links or require password change on next sign-in.
