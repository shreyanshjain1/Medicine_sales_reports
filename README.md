## Database layout
This repo now includes a cleaner database structure:
- `database/schema.sql` is the single consolidated schema for fresh installs
- `database/seed_demo.sql` is an optional seed template
- `database/legacy_upgrade_bundle.sql` is a convenience reference for older installs
- legacy `upgrade_v*.sql` files are still kept for backward compatibility and patch history

## Setup
### Fresh install
1. Copy `config.example.php` to `config.php`
2. Set your database credentials and secrets in `config.php`
3. Import `database/schema.sql`
4. Ensure these folders are writable:
   - `uploads/attachments`
   - `uploads/signatures`
   - `storage/logs`
5. Open `public/`

### Existing install
1. Back up your current database and files
2. Copy in the updated project files
3. Prefer aligning older databases to the consolidated structure manually, or use the legacy upgrade SQL files if needed
4. Keep `config.php` intact

## Notes
- `setup.php` now reads from the consolidated schema file instead of duplicating table definitions inline
- the app bootstraps missing `uploads/` and `storage/` folders automatically on startup
- `public/error_log` should not be committed; runtime logs belong in `storage/logs/`

## Why this version is stronger
This repo now looks more like a maintainable business application instead of a patch-stacked demo: cleaner install path, cleaner repo structure, consolidated database source-of-truth, and better separation between app files, uploads, and runtime logs.
